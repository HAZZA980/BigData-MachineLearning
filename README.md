# Python - Predicting Survival Rate on the Titanic

Description:
This GitHub repository contains the code for a project that predicts the survival rate of passengers on the Titanic using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The project is implemented in Python and utilizes popular data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and PySpark.

Overview:
The main goal of this project is to predict the survival rate of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as passenger class, gender, age, and embarkation point. The project is divided into several steps, including data preprocessing, feature selection, and model building. The following libraries are used:

    NumPy: For numerical operations.
    Pandas: For data processing and analysis.
    Matplotlib: For data visualization.
    Seaborn: For advanced data visualization.
    PySpark: For distributed data processing (Spark 3.2). 

Key Steps:
    - Data Preprocessing: The project begins with data preprocessing, where the dataset is cleaned and prepared for analysis. This includes handling missing values, dropping unnecessary columns, and converting categorical variables into numerical format.
    - Feature Selection: After preprocessing, the project selects the relevant features for predicting survival rates. Features such as passenger class, gender, age, and embarkation point are chosen as they are believed to have an impact on survival.
    - Machine Learning: The project employs PySpark, a powerful tool for large-scale data processing, to create a machine learning pipeline. This pipeline includes feature vectorization and label indexing to prepare the data for modeling.
    - Model Building: Several machine learning models are trained and evaluated to predict the survival rate. The performance of each model is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

    Visualization: Throughout the project, data visualization techniques are used to gain insights into the dataset and visualize the results. Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for creating informative graphs and plots.

Repository Contents:

    Jupyter Notebook: The main code for this project is available in a Jupyter Notebook format. It includes step-by-step explanations and code for each stage of the project.

    Dataset: The Titanic dataset used for this project is included in the repository for reference.
